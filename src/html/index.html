            <h2>INTERACTIVE: Measles mapped</h2>
            <p>Vaccination has seen the number of people infected with measles fall from around 4 million in the early 1980s to just under 200,000 last year. The World Health Organization set a goal of 90% of 1-year-olds to be vaccinated by 2015, increasing to 95% by 2020. Explore the changes in vaccination coverage and number of cases in countries worldwide from 1980 to 2013 using the interactive maps and charts below.</p>
